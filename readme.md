SEIR129 Project 1 - Simon memory game
This is a replica of the popular Simon memory game, wherein the user memorizes the order and color of highlighted squares and then clicks the squares to reiterate the order.

This application was made as my first project for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive 129

Built using HTML, CSS, and JS
